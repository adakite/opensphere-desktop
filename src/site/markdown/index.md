OpenSphere Desktop
==================

OpenSphere Desktop is an open-source virtual globe that supports visualization and analysis of geospatial and temporal data from a variety of sources, using open standards.

OpenSphere Desktop provides the following analytical and data access capabilities:

 * Animation and video capture
 * Data filtering
 * Merge multi-source feature data into a single layer
 * Import user files (CSV, ESRI Shapefile, KML, GeoTIFF, GeoPackage, etc.)
 * User Points, Tracks and Regions of Interest
 * Ops Clock
 * Layer and Place names search
 * Analytics (Count By, Histogram, XY Scattergram, Pie chart)
 * Ability to save OpenSphere Desktop state
 * Connectivity to external servers, such as OGC, ArcGIS, GeoServer, and many others

OpenSphere Desktop runs as a Java based, desktop application. It utilizes OGC services to support both tile and feature based animations. OpenSphere Desktop provides the analytic capability to temporally and geospatially manipulate data layers created from single or multiple sources in a 3-dimensional representation of the earth. It has the ability to handle 250,000+ features that can be pulled from multiple sources.

OpenSphere Desktop is compatible with Linux, Microsoft Windows, and Mac OS platforms and can be used in either a standalone or server based architecture. OpenSphere Desktop utilizes the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) services, specifically Web Map Service (WMS), Web Feature Service (WFS) and Web Processing Service (WPS), to access data sources.
