# Development Guide

This guide is provided to help developers new to the application create and maintain plugins for the Desktop tool. The guide is geared toward development environments similar to that in which the tool was originally developed. Specifically, it assumes the environment is using Java 8, Eclipse as an IDE, Maven and ANT to build the application, and Subversion for source control. It is perfectly reasonable to develop plugins in other environments, but that exercise is left to the reader, and may contain unforeseen challenges.

Contributers to the baseline must adhere to the coding standards defined in this document. Failure to adhere to these coding standards may result in the rejection of the merge request or reformatting / refactoring of the submission to meet standards, at the discretion of the project's governing body.
