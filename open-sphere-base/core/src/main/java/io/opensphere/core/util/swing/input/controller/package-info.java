/**
 * This package makes it easier to create forms for user input.
 *
 * The classes help reduce the amount of boilerplate GUI code that needs to be
 * written, and instead focus on choosing the data type that best matches the
 * data being input.
 *
 * Features include: - Automatic use of the most appropriate Swing component for
 * the data - Ability to choose the Swing component through a constructor
 * argument - Automatic validation and user notification of errors Support for
 * adding InputData directly to an InputPanel, avoiding having to deal with
 * layout managers
